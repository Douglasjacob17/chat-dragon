        <h6>Author : <strong>Sammy Rheatt</strong></h6>    
        <p class="story"><strong class="begin">I awake to the sound of a throbbing, droning noise.</strong> Rubbing my eyes, it takes a second to realize what the sound is. <em>Red alert,</em> I think to myself,<em> Battle stations.</em> Soon the voice over the intercom says, <em>RED ALERT, BATTLE STATIONS.</em> Instinctively, I leap out of bed and prepare to throw on my blues, when I realize my current location. <em>The brig.</em></p>
        <p class="story">Yep, evidently I forgot that I was in the brig. <em>Idiot!</em> It all comes back clearly now; harsh words with a fellow sailor, loud voices, fists thrown, and me getting my butt handed to me. Now that I think of it, that "fellow sailor" is in fact a superior officer. <em>Cap's second!</em>, I think to myself, <em>How could I deck the second?! Stupid, stupid, stupid!</em> I yell for the guard, but receive no answer. "Guard! Come on, man!", I say desperately, "There's a fight happening! I gotta get out there! The cap knows I'm the best gunner this side of the Hyades!" I give up, when I hear something coming from outside the metal room.</p>
